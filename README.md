What’s in My Pantry
A grocery inventory system for busy home cooks

What’s in My Pantry will allow home cooks to make grocery lists on the go or spur of the moment trips to the grocery store while preventing duplicate purchases. By eliminating purchasing items that they already have on hand, What’s in My Pantry reduces food waste and helps save money.

When making a grocery list while not in the comfort of your own kitchen, it can be difficult or impossible to remember what items you have on hand – especially those cans that get shoved to the back of the cabinet. Or if you decide on the way home from work to drop by the grocery store to grab the ingredients for a meal you’ve been craving – will you remember if you still have a particular spice on hand?

What’s in My Pantry aims to solve this problem – once you have an account set up with you inventory added to it, you can refer to the app at any time to see if you’ve got any ingredients – or if you’ve run out of any basics.

“This app is easy to use and aims to be a time-saver – no more trips home to make sure you’re not out of cumin.” – Grace Halbert, creator of What’s in My Pantry

To get started, all a user needs to do is navigate to the website, set up an account and start adding items to their virtual pantry.

“What’s in My Pantry has helped me stop buying items I already have at home – now I’ll know when I’ve got baking powder so I’ll never end up with three cans again.” – Mr. Fake Customer, a user of What’s in My Pantry
